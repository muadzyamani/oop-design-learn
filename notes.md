# Introduction
## Learn object-oriented design principles
*   **Core Problem Addressed:** The tendency to jump straight into programming a new idea without a proper design phase.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Start with a good design to avoid wasting time and going down the wrong path.
*   **Course Focus:** The fundamentals of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), which is the process of planning a program *before* writing a single line of code.
*   **Benefits of Proper OO Design:** Enables the creation of applications that are:
    *   Flexible
    *   Maintainable
    *   Extensible
*   **Course Process:**
    1.  Introduce foundational concepts and terminology for object-oriented development.
    2.  Demonstrate a process to deconstruct an idea (e.g., something written "on the back of a napkin") into the right components to know exactly what code to write.
*   **Tools Used:**
    *   This is **not** a coding course.
    *   The course will use basic components of the **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** to diagram visual models.
    *   UML is a tool to articulate ideas and collaborate with others on a design.

## What you should know

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   A basic understanding of programming fundamentals (variables, functions, loops, conditions).
    *   Familiarity with object-oriented concepts like classes and objects is helpful but not required.
*   **Target Audience:**
    1.  Developers currently using an OO language but who may not be using it to its full extent or are struggling to maintain a growing application.
    2.  Experienced programmers with a background in non-object-oriented languages (like C) who find it difficult to transition to an object-oriented mindset.
*   **Course Philosophy:**
    *   The focus is on the **object-oriented design process**, not on programming.
    *   The tools are simple and accessible: pencil and paper, index cards, and whiteboardsâ€”not a code editor or IDE.
    *   Object-oriented design is not a single formal process but a set of ideas and techniques to incorporate into your own workflow.
*   **Learning Encouragement:**
    *   The course includes several challenge problems.
    *   It is strongly encouraged to actively think about the challenges and review the provided solutions to get the most out of the course.
